## Intervals
Note that all data here is gathered along with all graduate course data.

There is a 0.5 second delay between requests (note that this delay is *significantly* lower compared to the previous times I've been doing this, and may be adjusted).

Thus, expect one full cycle (i.e., 1148 requests) to be completed in **574** seconds, or approximately a 10 minute interval between requests to the *same* course.

## Notices
I do not have data for May 25, 2022, from approximately 4:20 AM to approximately 11:00 AM Pacific Time. The cause of this is due my login script encountering a fatal error when trying to log back into WebReg. This means that a lot of freshmen first pass enrollment data is unfortunately missing.
